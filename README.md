# Food Factory Management System (FFMS)
A web-based system to manage ingredient inventory, production batches, quality inspections, and shipment workflows in a food manufacturing unit, ensuring safety compliance and operational traceability.

## Project Overview
The Food Factory Management System (FFMS) is a web-based application designed to manage ingredient inventory, production activities, quality inspections, and shipment processes within a food manufacturing unit. The system provides a centralized platform to monitor and control the complete workflow from raw material receipt to finished goods dispatch.

## Problem it Solves
Food factories often rely on manual records or disconnected tools to manage inventory and quality checks. This creates challenges in tracking ingredient expiry dates, enforcing safety inspections, maintaining batch traceability, and monitoring production status. FFMS addresses these issues by introducing a structured digital workflow that improves operational control and reduces the risk of human error.

## Target Users 
- Inventory Supervisor – manages ingredient batches and stock levels
- Production Manager – plans and monitors production schedules  
- Quality Inspector – performs and records safety inspections  
- Shipping Clerk – handles dispatch of approved finished goods  
- System Administrator – manages users and maintains system records  

## Vision Statement
To develop a centralized system that enforces food safety checkpoints, tracks ingredient freshness, and provides clear visibility into production and inventory operations through an organized digital workflow.

## Key Features
- Ingredient batch tracking with expiry date monitoring  
- Production scheduling based on available inventory  
- Mandatory quality inspection before dispatch  
- Shipment allowed only for approved batches  
- Role-based access control and audit logging  
- Dashboard for monitoring operational activities  

## Success Metrics
- Accurate tracking of ingredient batches and expiry details  
- Enforcement of inspection checkpoints before shipment  
- Improved visibility of inventory and production status  
- Complete traceability of production batches  

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Developed as an academic project using open-source tools  
- Focus on process modeling rather than industrial automation  
- Users have basic computer literacy and internet access  
- Project completion within the academic timeline
